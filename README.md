---
- Generated data for training and testing
![initial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagarmk/logistic_regression_from_scratch/master/images/generated_data.png) 
- Picked up a sigmoid link function 
- Calculated the log likelihood:
Log likelihood can be viewed as a sum over all the training data point
